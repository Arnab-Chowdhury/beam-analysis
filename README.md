# Beam Analysis
This project contains MATLAB scripts for analyzing shear force, bending moments, and deflections in beams.

## Features
- Supports both simply supported and cantilever beams.
- Handles point loads, uniformly varying loads, and point moments.
- Plots Shear Force Diagram (SFD), Bending Moment Diagram (BMD), and Deflection Curve.

## Files
- `beam.m`: Main script to run the analysis.
- `forceDiagrams.m`: Function for simply supported beams.
- `forceDiagrams2.m`: Function for cantilever beams.

## Usage
Open the files in MATLAB and run the `beam.m` script.
